# My First Web Blogpost

This is a code-along exercise with @CoreyMSchafer. The purpose of writing this web application is to familarise myself with using Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy.


## About this Blogpost

Every visitor can view all posts written by registered bloggers. Each post consists of these five components:

1. Blogger's profile picture

2. Blogger's username

3. Date posted

4. Post title

5. Post content

Visitors can also see all posts posted by a particular blogger.

Once each blogger logins, the blogger performs the following:

1. View the same amount of posts, as all visitors do

2. Cannot update and delete other bloggers' posts.

3. Can create, update and delete own posts.

4. Can update username, email and profile picture.

## Conclusion

I have learnt something by doing this exercise:

* Building different GET and POST routes using decorator

* Connecting routes to HTML templates using render_template function

* Saving, inserting, and deleting records into and from SQLAlchemy database

* Internal documenting the functions to clearly explain its purpose, its input data, and its return value

* Building a reusable HTML template and applying it in different other HTML files.

## Tools

For creating this blogpost, I use these libraries and tools.

* Visual Studio Code

* Python3.8

* Flask

* SQLAlchemy

* HTML5, Bootstrap4.4.0

* Git
